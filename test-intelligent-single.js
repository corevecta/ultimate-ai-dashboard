YOUR INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS TASK:
1. Read the specification YAML file
2. Examine the project folder name and structure
3. Analyze the project name and description
4. DETERMINE the correct platform type based on ALL available evidence:
   - Project ID pattern (cvp-[platform]-[name])
   - Project name and description content
   - Features mentioned in the specification
   - Technical stack choices
   - File structure and context

PLATFORM DETECTION RULES:
- Chrome Extension: project ID contains 'chrome-extension', or name/features mention browser extension, Chrome, manifest, etc.
- API Service: project ID contains 'api-service', 'api-rest', 'api-graphql', or features describe API endpoints, microservices
- Mobile App: project ID contains 'mobile-app', 'android-app', 'ios-app', or features mention mobile, app stores
- Web App: project ID contains 'web-app', 'saas', 'pwa', or features describe web application, SaaS platform
- Discord Bot: project ID contains 'discord-bot', or features mention Discord commands, bot functionality
- CLI Tool: project ID contains 'cli-tool', or features describe command-line interface, terminal commands

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. If the specification's project.type is WRONG (doesn't match the evidence), OVERRIDE IT
2. Fix ALL discrepancies, empty arrays, and placeholder content
3. Generate requirements that match the ACTUAL platform type you determined
4. Include platform-specific technical requirements, constraints, and best practices

REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT STRUCTURE:
Based on the platform you identify, create a comprehensive, implementation-ready document following this EXACT structure:

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimum 3500 words
- Specific, actionable content (no generic fluff)
- Implementation-ready details
- Fix ALL specification issues
- Ensure consistency throughout

Remember: You're the expert. Analyze everything available and make intelligent decisions about what this project REALLY is, regardless of what the specification claims.

YOUR SPECIFIC TASK:
1. Read the specification file: ${path.join(projectDir, 'ai-generated', 'specification.yaml')}
2. Also read if it exists: ${path.join(projectDir, 'ai-generated', 'market-enhanced-spec.yaml')}
3. Examine the project ID: ${projectId}
4. Analyze ALL available context to determine the correct platform
5. Generate comprehensive requirements based on your platform determination
6. Save to: ${outputFile}

Remember: Use your intelligence to determine what this project REALLY is, not what the spec claims.
Fix all issues and create implementation-ready requirements.
