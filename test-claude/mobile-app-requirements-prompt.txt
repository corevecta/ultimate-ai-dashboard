# Generate requirements.md for ${projectId}

You are generating requirements for a MOBILE APP project.

Read specification.yaml and create requirements.md (min 2000 words).

Project: ${projectId.split('-').slice(3).join(' ').replace(/-/g, ' ').toUpperCase()}

Include:
1. Mobile App Overview (iOS/Android)
2. 8-12 features with:
   - Screen flows and navigation
   - Native features (camera, GPS, push)
   - Offline functionality
   - Data synchronization
   - Platform-specific UI
3. Technical Architecture (React Native/Flutter/Native)
4. Mobile-specific requirements (app stores, permissions)
5. Development Guidelines
6. Testing Strategy (device testing, app store compliance)

Focus on mobile app specifics, not web features.
