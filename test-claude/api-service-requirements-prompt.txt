# Generate requirements.md for ${projectId}

You are generating requirements for an API SERVICE project.

Read specification.yaml and create requirements.md (min 2000 words).

Project: ${projectId.split('-').slice(3).join(' ').replace(/-/g, ' ').toUpperCase()}

Include:
1. API Service Overview
2. 8-12 API endpoints with:
   - Method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
   - Path and parameters
   - Request/response formats
   - Authentication requirements
   - Rate limiting
3. Technical Architecture (backend stack, database, deployment)
4. API Design principles (REST/GraphQL, versioning, errors)
5. Development Guidelines
6. Testing Strategy (unit, integration, load testing)

Focus on API-specific requirements, not generic web app features.
