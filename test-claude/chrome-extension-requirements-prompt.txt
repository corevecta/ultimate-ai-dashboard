# Generate requirements.md for ${projectId}

You are generating requirements for a CHROME EXTENSION project.

Read specification.yaml and create requirements.md (min 2000 words).

Project: ${projectId.split('-').slice(3).join(' ').replace(/-/g, ' ').toUpperCase()}

Include:
1. Chrome Extension Overview (Manifest V3)
2. 8-12 features with:
   - User interaction flow
   - Content script implementation
   - Background service worker logic
   - Chrome APIs used
   - UI components (popup, options)
3. Technical Architecture (extension structure, permissions)
4. Chrome-specific requirements (CSP, storage, messaging)
5. Development Guidelines
6. Testing Strategy (extension testing, Chrome Web Store compliance)

Focus on browser extension specifics, not generic web features.
